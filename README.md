# Food Recipes API with Express and Prisma

## Description

This project is a simple RESTful API built with **Express.js** and **Prisma ORM** to manage a list of food recipes. It demonstrates how to set up an Express server, organize routes, controllers, and models, and interact with a database using Prisma for efficient and type-safe data operations.

The database used in this project contains a table with 20 fruit records, each having an `id` and a `name`. This serves as a sample dataset to illustrate how to work with database records through Prisma.
